# VLSI Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress in learning VLSI design using Verilog.  
I am implementing various combinational and sequential circuits and documenting my experiments, simulations, and learning notes.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Projects Overview

The repository will include:

- Verilog modules for different digital circuits  
- Testbenches to simulate and verify each module  
- Simulation outputs and waveform files (optional images/screenshots)  
- Notes about my learning process and observations  

The goal is to track my growth in VLSI design, understand digital logic concepts, and practice Verilog systematically.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Only Verilog source and testbench files are tracked in Git.  
- Compiled simulation executables and waveform files are ignored via `.gitignore`.  
- Screenshots or images of simulation outputs are included optionally for reference.
